# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play
Analyzing Google Play Store data, this project delves into app categories, user behavior, and market trends, offering actionable insights for developers and stakeholders navigating the Android App Market landscape.


Mobile applications have become ubiquitous, offering both simplicity in creation and potential profitability. This proliferation has led to an increasing number of app developments. In this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by examining over ten thousand apps available on Google Play across various categories. By delving into this data, we seek to extract valuable insights that can guide strategies for enhancing growth and user retention.

The dataset comprises two main files:

1. googleplaystore.csv: This file contains exhaustive details about applications available on Google Play. It includes 13 features that characterize each app.
2. googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv: With a compilation of 100 reviews for each app, this file presents user sentiments in a pre-processed form. These sentiments are classified into three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral, along with additional attributes such as Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
